<div><p class="newstext">Hello, it's me, Samidy. I'm very sorry to announce this album's getting delayed from the previous date of May 30, 2025 to May 31, 2025. We are very sorry for this delay, we were sure we were able to release it on the 30th of May, but due to personal reasons, album hosting issues, and tweaks to the tracklist and album, we have to delay it by at least 1 day. We promise, for realsies, 31st of May. This album was already a mess to create, it's a miracle it even finished, and even more of a miracle that we still managed to line it up with our broad release window (before June), even barely. We are very excited to release this album, it genuinely took a LOT of effort to make, from writing lyrics, scripts, finding beats, getting me and oje on at the same time, which order we make it in, story, etc. This album took 2 months to make, which is a lot since these are meme albums, which seem (ironically) to have no effort put into at all at surface level. We asked our label, Terrance Equity for Records And Recordings incorporated For Boosted Loved Equity (TERRIBLE for short) to let us delay it just one more time (we have delayed it MULTIPLE times). They agreed. We hope this album is genuinely as funny, silly, and lore filled as you hoped (if you had any hope at all, or even cared for it). We also committed to NEVER release ANYTHING on a Friday, whether album or not due to personal reasons. We planned the 30th of May, even though it's a Friday, since we thought it was a good time. We planned on giving an exception but we couldn't. Final Release Date: 31st of May!!! Much Love - Samidy</p></div>
